# muGAN

Implementation of the SHiP muon background Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The networks are based on those in the SHiP paper [Fast simulation of muons produced at the SHiP
experiment using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04451).

## How to use

Import the library:
```
from SHiP_GAN_module import muGAN
```
